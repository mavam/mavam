# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile! It's great to have you here.

I'm Matthias Vallentin, founder and CEO at [Tenzir](https://tenzir.com), where I
work on data pipelines for security operations.

Before that, I completed my PhD in computer science and postdoctoral research at
the University of California, Berkeley, where I had the good fortune of being
advised by [Vern Paxson](https://www.icir.org/vern).
